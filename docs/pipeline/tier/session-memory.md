## Domain Terminology
_Populated by BA from product docs and requirements. Use these terms consistently across all phases._

## Codebase Behaviour
_What was found in the codebase and docs, and how it behaves/is set up. Updated by each phase._

## Key Decisions
- Branch name `raidlc/ai_tier` used across all repos _(Phase 0)_
- Thrift directory treated as read-only reference (not a git repo) _(Phase 0)_
- Multi-epic coordination enabled with registry at BaljeetSinghCapillaryTech/kalpavriksha _(Phase 0)_
- Epic name in registry: `tier-category` (mapped from "Tiers CRUD", covers E1-US1/US2/US3). Assigned to Ritwik (Layer 2). _(Phase 0)_
- Interface philosophy: Option A (Hybrid — Direct UI + aiRa) chosen per BRD recommendation _(Phase 0 — from BRD Section 5)_

## Constraints
- Scope limited to "Tiers CRUD" — subset of the full Tiers & Benefits BRD (Epic E1 primarily) _(Phase 0)_
- Tech stack: Java, Spring, Thrift, MySQL, MongoDB, Flyway, JUnit 4, Mockito _(Phase 0)_
- Four repos involved: emf-parent (entities/strategies), intouch-api-v3 (REST/maker-checker), peb (tier downgrade), Thrift (IDL definitions) _(Phase 0)_
- UI screenshots pending from user for v0.app tier management screens _(Phase 0)_

## Risks & Concerns
- jdtls LSP: installed (v1.57.0, Java 23), running via /tmp/emf-parent symlink. Patched find_daemon_for_cwd for symlink resolution. _(Phase 0)_ -- Status: mitigated
- Registry repo has full decomposition on `raidlc/rtest123/epic-division` branch. _(Phase 0)_ -- Status: mitigated
- tier-category consumes maker-checker-framework (owner: ritwik) and audit-trail-framework (owner: anuj). Both status: "designed" (not built yet). Will need mocks during development. _(Phase 0)_ -- Status: open

## Open Questions
- [ ] What specific screens from the v0.app UI should be captured as screenshots? _(Phase 0)_
- [x] resolved: Registry has full decomposition at `raidlc/rtest123/epic-division`. Epic `tier-category` assigned to Ritwik. _(Phase 0)_

## Rework Log
_Tracks re-run cycles to detect unresolved loops._
